Vandalizer is in active development and currently utilizes commercial large language models (LLMs) provided by third-party services. Future developments will enable secure document processing on-premises, but for now please **do not input sensitive, confidential, or personally identifiable information**. This includes proposal narratives, which should only be shared if you are certain you have the right to do so. Proposal narratives may contain patentable ideas and sharing them could jeopardize intellectual property rights. In addition, large document handling is not yet available. Users should limit pdf file inputs to documents with **less than 50 pages.**
