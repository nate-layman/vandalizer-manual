# Example Workflow
:::

Workflows are best understood through practice. The following section offers a walkthrough building an example workflow and provides some suggested use-cases. 

Let’s say that a user wants to use Vandalizer to create an RFA checklist. RFA’s often contain similar information, but it may not always be communicated the same way between RFA documents. For this reason, the user is going to need added flexibility from Vandalizer, so they will select a prompt task to extract key information from the RFA such as deadlines, eligibility criteria, award information, or application criteria.  The user wants their output structured in a table so that information can be easily compared between documents. Here are the steps that the user will take.

Upload an RFA. This step will allow Vandalizer to perform OCR and extract text from the document. Wait until the OCR process is finished as indicated by the spinner icon  changing to a data display icon  .

Create tasks. This workflow requires the coordination of two tasks, a prompt task and formatting task. To add these tasks, the user will click the      button at the bottom of the toolbox window, then click +New Task to add each task. For both a prompt task and formatting task, the user will name the task, then write their query for Vandalizer. 

Create a workflow. Once the user creates some tasks, they are ready to create a workflow that coordinates these tasks. To do this, the user will press the Workflows tab on the right side of the toolbox window. From there, the user will click on +New Workflow. 

Coordinate steps. The user determines how information will flow between steps in their workflow. All tasks within a step receive the same input. In this case, information from the prompt step will flow downstream to the formatting step. Therefore, the user determines that this workflow requires a two-step process where the prompt task is assigned to step 1 and the formatting task is assigned to step 2. 

Assign tasks to each step. Under the workflows tab, the user adds two steps, titling them “RFA Extraction” and “Format RFA Checklist.” Then, the user clicks on each step to assign pre-made tasks to each step. 

Run workflow. Now that the user’s tasks are appropriately assembled and coordinated, the user is ready to run the workflow. The user clicks Run Workflow in the bottom right corner of the toolbox window and Vandalizer produces the desired output. 

Apply to other documents. This workflow is saved into the user’s Vandalizer workspace. Now the user can run the same assemblage of tasks on future RFA’s.

# Other Workflow Ideas
:::

- RFA checklist creation tool. Using a prompt task identify key dates, deadlines, eligibility criteria, award information, application criteria. A prompt task is best here because the necessary information won’t always be present in the same place between RFA’s. 
  
- NSF award notice Extraction. Using an extract task important information from an award letter such as PI, dates, or total budget can be extracted. Because NSF award notices use a standard format an extraction task is a better choice than a prompt task.
