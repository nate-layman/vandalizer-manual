# Workflows
:::


A **workflow** is a coordinated assemblage of AI tasks, organized into steps that Vandalizer performs in sequence. Designing workflows can take some time and consideration, but their reproducibility can save RA offices substantial time, particularly for multi-step processes that will be repeated.

## Steps
All tasks within a step receive the same input and run independantly of each other
:::

Workflows arrange AI tasks into sequential groups called steps. The purpose of a step is to organize the inputs available to tasks. All tasks within a step receive the same input and all tasks within a step contribute to the step output. The outputs from an upstream step will inform the inputs for a downstream step. For example, a user might ask Vandalizer to extract key information from an NSF Notice of Award (Step 1), then format that information into a template (step 2). This workflow ensures that Vandalizer extracts the same information from each NSF NOA (step 1), and that the outputs are structured consistently, without duplicate information (step 2).
