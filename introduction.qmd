## Understanding Vandalizer Components

Within Vandalizer, users can create **tasks**, which are specific, repeatable jobs handled by AI. These tasks can be collected into **steps** with every task within each step receiving the same input. Steps can then be chained together, where downstream steps receive input from upstream steps, creating structured, repeatable **workflows**.

These Workflows—tasks coordinated into steps—can be reused across documents with similar formats or content. All tasks and workflows are organized within **workspaces**, which serve as centralized hubs for managing and tracking work. Workspaces can be customized to align with the needs of a Research Administration office, organized by individual users, job roles, or document types.

*With Vandalizer, Research Administrators can create efficient, reusable systems that improve consistency and productivity across their document and data processing tasks.*
